                When Iâ€™m not working, I like to spend my time<br>
                    - Playing the piano<br>
                    - Traveling, exploring new places<br>
                    - Nerding out to 80s music / movies (Currently hooked onto Miami Vice :o)<br>
                    - Binging away at GTA, RDR, Fallout, or CS:GO!
